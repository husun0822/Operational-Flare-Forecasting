# Operational Flare Forecasting

This repo is created (Apr. 27th, 2022) to store the references, databases and codes for the operational flare forecasting project. The following topics are of interest in building an operational flare forecasting pipeline:

* Existing works on operational flare forecasting system
* Flare Forecasting Standard Dataset
* Standard approach of validating the machine learning model
* Uncertainty Quantification
* Use a mixture of imaging data and vector time-series features for flare forecast (Multi-modality learning)
* Online flare forecasting algorithm/model
