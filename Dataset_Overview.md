# Solar Flare Datasets: What we have and how we can access more

This readme document is written to give a general overview about the existing datasets we have right now and give some additional guidance and resources for obtaining additional data. Please update the information here if you have new resources.

### Existing Datasets (What we have so far):

Our data for solar flare forecasting machine learning works are measured in Terabytes (TB), making it hard to keep a local copy of the entire database. But since the data are organized in a hierachical structure, one can always compile a smaller amount of data files to test models & do feature engineering locally on your own laptop.
